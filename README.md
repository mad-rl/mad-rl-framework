Street Fighter 2 Gym Retro Environment
===

This environment uses OpenAI Gym Retro to allow implement RL algorithms easily for the Genesis version of Street Fighter 2.

## Architecture

We have split the environment in different components trying to simplify the implementation of new algorithms. These components are very common in most of the RL approaches.
